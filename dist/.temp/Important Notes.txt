Project Notes
================

PROBLEM A:
-------------
The Plugin "jquery.mCustomScrollbar.js" located at "/gentelella/vendors/malihu-custom-scrollbar-plugin/"
has a problem in the line 2400, requiring it to be changed from:

    $(window).load(function(){

to:

    $(window).on("load",function() {


PROBLEM B:
-------------
The provided "JQVMap" has a problem in the "jquery.vmap.js" file, located at "/gentelella/vendors/jqvmap/dist/".
If you encounter an error saying "TypeError: this.countries[d].setFill is not a function" and some of the
page charts fail to display in the page as a result of it, you may need to modify the unminified version
and replace the line 938 where it reads:

    if (this.countries[code]) {

with the following:

    if (this.countries.hasOwnProperty(code)) {

Notice this plugin (the JQVMap) is a heavily modified version of jVectorMap, from 2012.

The version currently in this demo is 1.5.1, which is still the same active version in the official repository,
and the same problem is still present in the current version, just in the line 946.
