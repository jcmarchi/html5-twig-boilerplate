    <h1>Error!</h1>
    <h3>This is a generic Error Page rendered without any templating. </h3>
    <p>If you are seeing this message your <b>Twig</b> (and/or <b>Composer</b>) may be disabled in the <i>configuration file</i>.</p>
    <p>You don't need to use any template system, Composer or even MOODFIRED to build your site using this Boilerplate.</p>
    <p>For more details and suggestions about coding practices and how to take advantage of this Boilerplate structure please refer to the documentation.</p>
    <p>You can find the HTML file for this page (<b>error.html</b>) in the <b>"pages/static/"</b> folder of your site.</p>
    <p>Feel free to modify this page as needed. However, it would be much better to adjust your <i>configuration file</i> to route errors to a different page, if needed.</p>
