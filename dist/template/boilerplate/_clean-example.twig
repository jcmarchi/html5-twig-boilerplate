{# Don't forget to set the <title> of your page. #}
{% block title %}{{boilerplate.settings.software.sitename}} | The CLEAN Page{% endblock %}

 These BLOCKS are available in the "page.twig" file so you can insert snippets from here.
 You can also 'include' files here and they will be added to the page in the right block.

 For most Web Applications and Sites - including online stores - the current template
 model should suffice. All the elements are present and it is fairly easy to adjust the
 look and feel of each block via CSS.

 In few cases, you can simply make a copy of the Master Layout named 'page.twig' and
 change it to your needs. Then, adjust the template {% extends %} of your page to load
 your new file and you can have countless templates for all your needs.

 The sessions below, if not used, can simply be left empy. You don't need to delete them.

 Ther are a couple of "Special Blocks" in the 'page.twig' that are listed in the comments
 at the end of this page. Use it wisely.

{# Here is how to add a content inside the <body> tag #}
{% block BODY %}
{% include 'snippets/snippet-example.twig' ignore missing %}
    <h3>This is a CLEAN HTML page</h3>
    <h5>It has been rendered via HTML5â€”Twig Boilerplate System, but almost everything else was ignored!</h5>
    <p>You are seeing this message because <b>Twig</b> and <b>Composer</b> are properly set and enabled in the <i>configuration file</i>.</p>
    <p>This is the CLEAN PAGE (using <b>clean.example.twig</b>). There is no much to see here. Most of the configuration file has been
    ignored and only jQuery and Boostrap have been loaded. This is the most <i>basic and plain vanila example</i> other than an entirely wiping out the template.</p>
    <p>This example can be used for new pages requiring full template customization, entirely new website structures, and even for learning.</p>
    <p>For more details and suggestions about coding practices and how to take advantage of this Boilerplate structure please refer to the documentation.</p>

Assuming you need to add some important meta, script, or css inside the <head> tag
of the template, you can use the tag below to inject content either BEFORE or AFTER
the parent contens (just use the {{ parent() }} reference object).

If you don't use the {{ parent() }} reference object, the entire contents of the <head>
tag will be replaced by the new contents.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #}
{% block HEAD %}
{{ parent() }}
{% endblock %}

 Service Blocks
