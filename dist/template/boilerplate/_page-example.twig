{# Don't forget to set the <title> of your page. #}
{% block title %}{{boilerplate.settings.software.sitename}} | Page Example{% endblock %}

{# If you need to add anything to the <body> Tag itself, this is the place to do it: #}

{########################################################################################
 These BLOCKS are available in the "page.twig" file so you can insert snippets from here.
 You can also 'include' files here and they will be added to the page in the right block.

 For most Web Applications and Sites - including online stores - the current template
 model should suffice. All the elements are present and it is fairly easy to adjust the
 look and feel of each block via CSS.

 In few cases, you can simply make a copy of the Master Layout named 'page.twig' and
 change it to your needs. Then, adjust the template {% extends %} of your page to load
 your new file and you can have countless templates for all your needs.

 The sessions below, if not used, can simply be left empy. You don't need to delete them.

 Ther are a couple of "Special Blocks" in the 'page.twig' that are listed in the comments
 at the end of this page. Use it wisely.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #}

{# This is the BODY CONTENT of your page. #}
{% block bodycontent %}
{#
    Most of your page contents can be placed here.

    For most common implementations, you can add all your HTML here. The rest of the blocks
    are conevniently organized so you can either use them and style your page structure
    with CSS, but also to allow most templates to be easily dismantled and reassembled using
    the blocks below. Adjust can be made in this file (to add more blocks) and/or in the
    'page.template.twig' file to acommodate specific fine tunes beyond the proposed
    structure.

    Simply copy this file from the /layout/ folder to the location you need it to be inside
    your /template/ folder and full it up with your contents.

    Adjust your {% extends %} statement to reflect your /template/ folder and, if you renamed
    the 'page.template.twig', just make sure your page will extend the right layout.

{########################################################################################
 These BLOCKS are considered "Special Blocks" in the 'page.twig' because they overwrite
 entire block contents, and the results can be daring if yo don't know what yo are doing.
 USE THEM WISELY!

Assuming you need to add some important meta, script, or css inside the <body> tag
of the template, you can use the tag below to inject content either BEFORE or AFTER
the parent contens (just use the {{ parent() }} reference object).

If you don't use the {{ parent() }} reference object, the entire contents of the <head>
tag will be replaced by the new contents, and unless you know what you are doing,
everything should break.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #}
{% block head %}
{{ parent() }}
{% endblock %}

Assuming you need to add some important content, script, or css inside the <body> tag

If you don't use the {{ parent() }} reference object, the entire contents of the <body>
tag will be replaced by the new contents. Only a few scripts in the bottom of the tag
shall remain as they are "head" elements placed in the "body" element to allow the DOM
to finish loading before the scripts are parsed.
