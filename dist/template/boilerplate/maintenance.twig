    <h3>This Website is in Maintenance Mode!</h3>
    <h6>This is the Maintenance Page rendered by the Twig Templating System.</h6>
    <p>If you are seeing this message your <b>Twig</b> and <b>Composer</b> are properly enabled in the <i>configuration file</i>, and you have the <b><u>Maintencance Mode</u></b> set to <b>ON</b>.</p>
    <p>You don't need to use any template system, Composer or even MOODFIRED to build your site using this Boilerplate.</p>
    <p>For more details and suggestions about coding practices and how to take advantage of this Boilerplate structure please refer to the documentation.</p>
    <p>You can find the Twig file for this page (<b>maintenance.twig</b>) in the <b>"templates/boilerplate/"</b> folder of your site. It is renderd by the file <b>maintenance.php</b> located in the <b>"pages/boilerplate/common/"</b> folder.</p>
    <p>Feel free to modify this page as needed. However, it would be much better to adjust your <i>configuration file</i> to point your Maintenance Page to a different file, if needed.</p>
