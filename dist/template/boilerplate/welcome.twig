        <p>You are seeing this message because <b>Twig</b> and <b>Composer</b> are properly set and enabled in the <i>configuration file</i>.</p>
        <p>You can find the Twig file for this page (<b>welcome.twig</b>) in the <b>"template/boilerplate/"</b> folder of your site.<br>
           This Twig file is loaded and renderd by the <b>welcome.php</b> file located in the <b>"app/pages/common/"</b> folder.</p>
        <p>You can modify this page as needed and use it as the official Welcome Page for your site, but you can also adjust your <i>configuration file</i> to point your Welcome Page to a different file, if needed.</p>
        <p>For more details and suggestions about coding practices and how to take advantage of this Boilerplate structure please refer to the documentation.</p>
