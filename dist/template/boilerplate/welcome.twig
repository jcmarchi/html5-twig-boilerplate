{% extends "layout/page.template.twig" %}

{# Don't forget to set the <title> of your page. #}
{% block title %}Welcome | {{boilerplate.settings.software.sitename}}{% endblock %}

{########################################################################################
 These BLOCKS are available in the "page.twig" file so you can insert snippets from here.
 You can also 'include' files here and they will be added to the page in the right block.

 For most Web Applications and Sites - including online stores - the current template
 model should suffice. All the elements are present and it is fairly easy to adjust the
 look and feel of each block via CSS.

 In few cases, you can simply make a copy of the Master Layout named 'page.twig' and
 change it to your needs. Then, adjust the template {% extends %} of your page to load
 your new file and you can have countless templates for all your needs.

 The sessions below, if not used, can simply be left empy. You don't need to delete them.

 Ther are a couple of "Special Blocks" in the 'page.twig' that are listed in the comments
 at the end of this page. Use it wisely.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #}

{# This is the BODY CONTENT of your page. #}
{% block bodycontent %}
    {# The body of the page goes here. Just pleace it. #}
    <h3>This is a HTML page</h3>
    <h5> It has been rendered via HTML5â€”Twig Boilerplate System.</h5>
    <p>You are seeing this message because <b>Twig</b> and <b>Composer</b> are properly set and enabled in the <i>configuration file</i>.</p>
    <p>You can find the Twig file for this page (<b>welcome.twig</b>) in the <b>"template/boilerplate/"</b> folder of your site.<br>
       This Twig file is loaded and renderd by the <b>welcome.php</b> file located in the <b>"app/pages/common/"</b> folder.</p>
    <p>You can modify this page as needed and use it as the official Welcome Page for your site, but you can also adjust your <i>configuration file</i> to point your Welcome Page to a different file, if needed.</p>
    <p>For more details and suggestions about coding practices and how to take advantage of this Boilerplate structure please refer to the documentation.</p>

 USE THEM WISELY!

Assuming you need to add some important meta, script, or css inside the <head> tag
of the template, you can use the tag below to inject content either BEFORE or AFTER
the parent contens (just use the {{ parent() }} reference object).

If you don't use the {{ parent() }} reference object, the entire contents of the <head>
tag will be replaced by the new contents, and unless you know what you are doing,
everything should break.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #}
{% block HEAD %}
{{ parent() }}
{% endblock %}

{########################################################################################
Assuming you need to add some important content, script, or css inside the <body> tag
of the template, you can use the tag below to inject content either BEFORE or AFTER
the parent contens (just use the {{ parent() }} reference object).

If you don't use the {{ parent() }} reference object, the entire contents of the <body>
tag will be replaced by the new contents. Only a few scripts in the bottom of the tag
shall remain as they are "head" elements placed in the "body" element to allow the DOM
to finish loading before the scripts are parsed.

{% block BODY %}
{{ parent() }}
