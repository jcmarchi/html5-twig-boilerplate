# html5-twig-boilerplate
A Smart and professional **HTML5 Boilerplate** built for **Twig** and **PHP**, but that can also be used for non-Twig projects. Compliant with most modern HTML5 requirements and PHP 7.4+/8+.

The **HTML5 Twig Boilerplate** is a unique professional template architected to support and facilitate the construction of fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites. The structural model is designed to support construction of applications that require front-end and back-end independent areas, but can also be used to build simpler sites and projects.

This project is a by-product of over two decades of developing custom design applications of all sizes for clients worldwide. It is a solid and well taught environment that should be able to support any size project by taking in consideration and accounting for challenges that commonly arise later in custom design projects, and that many times result in re-coding and countless hours of manpower

With **HTML5 Twig Boilerplate** developers are not imposed over a specific development style, philosophy, or framework. Even the Twig addition is merely a convenience and it can easily be disabled (or replaced). My team and I strongly stand for the idea that developers should be free to architect their code in as they feel fit, and the flexibility of this **HTML5 Twig Boilerplate** is a testament to it.

## About This Repository

Before start using the **HTML5 Twig Boilerplate** in your projects, please notice this repository is where the **HTML5 Twig Boilerplate** is authored. As such, some of the tools, files, and processes are solely for the production of **HTML5 Twig Boilerplate**.

This **HTML5 Twig Boilerplate** core files for new projects are located in the ` /dist/ ` folder.

## Quick Start

Given the nature of this **HTML5 Twig Boilerplate**, we strongly suggest new and existing projects to start by following this few steps:

1. Download the **HTML5 Twig Boilerplate** repository via ZIP file and uncompress it on a temporary folder;
2. Create a new folder for your onw project and have GIT initialized in it if needed;
3. Copy the entire contents of ` /dist/ ` in the root of your new project and rename the `gitignore.txt` to `.gitignore` with proper changes.

That's it. You should be able to kickstart your new project and start writing code with no limitation.

For new projects, you will need to review the configuration files inside the ` /.config/ ` folder and adjust the configurations accordingly to your project needs, then you will need to run **COMPOSER INSTALL** in the root of your project to download the necessary external libraries (I.e. Twig). See the documentation for more details about the config files.

Existing projects may require custom review and redistribution of resources. Assuming developers will opt for using the **HTML Twig Boilerplate** suggested structure, the code must be adjusted. But, it is also possible to maintain existing code structure and simply move the current code into the new **HTML Twig Boilerplate** and, with minimum requirement of changes, have the old application implemented inside the new **HTML Twig Boilerplate** model.
